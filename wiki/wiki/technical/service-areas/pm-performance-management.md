## Deployment Guidance

When planning a deployment in Performance Management:

1. **Identify the service packages** that apply to your use case from the list above.
2. **Review the elements** — these are the systems and devices you will need. Check their Status (Existing vs Planned) to understand what is already deployed.
3. **Look up the functional requirements** — these define WHAT each element must do. They map directly to RFP/RFI specification sections.
4. **Check the interfaces** — these define HOW elements communicate. Each interface specifies data flows and applicable standards.
5. **Reference the standards** — for each interface, the architecture specifies which standards (NTCIP, TMDD, SAE, IEEE, etc.) should be used.

For a DOT preparing an RFI/RFP, the functional requirements are your specification backbone. Each requirement can be traced from service package → element → functional requirement → interface → standard.
