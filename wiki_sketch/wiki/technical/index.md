# PRDOT — Wiki Index

> This index is read by the LLM before answering any query.
> Each linked page contains pre-synthesized architectural knowledge.
> For specific element/interface/requirement lookups by ID, use keyword search.

## How the LLM Should Use This Wiki
1. Read this index to find the relevant page(s)
2. Open 1-2 pages for conceptual/deployment questions
3. For precise lookups (element by ID, specific interface), fall back to keyword search
4. For RFP/RFI questions, the service area page provides the traceability chain:
   Service Package → Elements → Functional Requirements → Interfaces → Standards
